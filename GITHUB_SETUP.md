2. Drag and drop these files from your local folder:
   - `github_pokemon_monitor.py`
   - The `.github/workflows/pokemon-monitor.yml` file (keep the folder structure)

### 3. Set Up Notifications (Choose Your Preferred Method)

#### Option A: Discord (Recommended - Easiest)
1. Create a Discord server or use an existing one
2. Create these channels: `#new_products`, `#errors`, and `#status` (optional)
3. Go to Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks
4. Create 3 separate webhooks (one for each channel):
   - **#new_products** webhook (for Pokemon product alerts)
   - **#errors** webhook (for error notifications)
   - **#status** webhook (for daily status updates - optional)
5. In your GitHub repo, go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
6. Add these secrets:
   - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_NEW_PRODUCTS`: Your #new_products webhook URL
   - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_ERRORS`: Your #errors webhook URL
   - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_STATUS`: Your #status webhook URL (optional)

#### Option B: Telegram
1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
2. Send `/newbot` and follow instructions
3. Save your bot token
4. Message your bot, then go to `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates` to find your chat ID
5. Add two GitHub secrets:
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your bot token
   - `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: Your chat ID

#### Option C: ntfy.sh (Push Notifications)
1. Download the ntfy app on your phone
2. Subscribe to a topic (make up a unique name like `your-pokemon-alerts-2024`)
3. Add GitHub secret:
   - `NTFY_TOPIC`: `https://ntfy.sh/your-unique-topic-name`

### 4. Enable GitHub Actions

1. In your repository, go to the "Actions" tab
2. Click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
3. Your monitor will now run every hour automatically!

### 5. Test It Manually

1. Go to Actions ‚Üí "Costco Pokemon Monitor"
2. Click "Run workflow" ‚Üí "Run workflow" (green button)
3. Wait 2-3 minutes and check if you get a notification

## üéØ How It Works

- **Completely FREE**: Uses GitHub's 2,000 free minutes per month
- **Runs every hour**: Checks Costco Australia for new Pokemon products
- **Zero maintenance**: Runs in the cloud, no need to keep your computer on
- **Instant notifications**: Get alerted on your phone the moment new products appear

## üìä Usage Limits

- GitHub Actions: 2,000 minutes/month (about 66 hours)
- Each run takes ~2-3 minutes
- Running every hour = ~72 minutes/month
- You're well within the free limit!

## üîß Customization

Want to check more frequently? Edit `.github/workflows/pokemon-monitor.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  # Every 15 minutes
  - cron: '*/15 * * * *'
  
  # Every hour at minute 0
  - cron: '0 * * * *'
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No notifications?
1. Check Actions tab for error logs
2. Verify your webhook/token secrets are correct
3. Test your Discord/Telegram/ntfy setup manually

### Want to see what's happening?
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí Latest run ‚Üí Click on the job
2. View logs to see what products were found

## üéâ That's It!

Your Pokemon monitor is now running 24/7 in the cloud for FREE! You'll get notified on your phone whenever Costco Australia adds new Pokemon products.
